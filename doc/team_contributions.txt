Dan:
I implemented the RealValueOptimProblem and AckleyFuction class. I also implemented non-linear inertia weight adjustment for experiment 8. Other than my part, I helped planning overall program architecture and fixing bug.

Rishi:
I wrote the PSO optimiser class as per the academic paper provided and refactored oir code to fit in a pso lib module. 

Damian:
I completed the development of both the Swarm class and the Topology class, as outlined in section 5.3. Also I set up and ran experiment 9 and wrote the analysis for the results.

Mitchell: I helped on the design of small parts of the code architecture and structure. I was also originally 
    planning to implement 5.4, but was delayed and ultimately moved to analyse the results of the standard 
    particle swarm optimization using Ackley function and then writing up its documentation. Aided in the 
    implementation of the code and especially its refactoring.

Gerald:
I wrote the code for 5.4 under the creating_graphs function, and carried out and wrote experiments 7, 8 and 10, alongside the analysis for each experiment.

Yu:
I did the Architecture design and Diagrams to aid with the production of code.
