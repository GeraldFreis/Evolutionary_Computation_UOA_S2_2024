Assignment_1_TSP

Instances are located in the `instances` folder.
Experiments are located in the `experiments` folder.
Experiment Results are located in the `results` folder.

Your code should have several classes, including:

- One for building the TSP problem from the instance files and constructing the fitness function.
- One for generating the initial population.
- Variation operators (different cross-overs and mutations).
- Selection operators (different parent selections and survival selections).
- One for different variations of GAs using different operators or you can different classes for each GA.

You should also have a main file for running the algorithms. Ofcourse you can design other classes and functions according to your preferences.

**NOTE** Run with command python experiment_1.py > experiment1.txt and similarly for experiment 2 and 3

Here I will denote how to run each file:

Exercise 1: TSProblem.py (this will show a random walk using the representation of the Travelling Salesman Problem)
Exercise 2: (TSProblem to show a random walk), experiment_1.py shows how you can create a population 
Exercise 6: shows how to link mutation and crossover operators with selection methods.
Exercise 7: experiment_4.py this is the file to run the InverOver representation of the paper.

We also have a PDF containing answers to all Exercises of this assignment.
