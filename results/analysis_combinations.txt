The results of experiment 10 are stored in the experiment_10_results file, with additional visualizations in metrics_combinations.md to include images, which cannot be embedded in text files.

The optimal combination based on best fitness is a ring swarm topology, constant weight adjustment, and 200 particles.
 As shown in Figure 15 of metrics_combinations.md, all 10 tests converge near zero best fitness by the 1000th iteration.
  No other combination achieves full convergence. The swarm converges slowly to the global optimum, as indicated by the consistently decreasing values in subplot 2, 
  though the particles remain spread, and learning continues, highlighted by the non-zero velocity vector magnitudes even at the final iteration. 
  This slow convergence aligns with the ring topology, where local best positions influence swarm behavior rather than global best positions, resulting in longer learning times and scattered particles.

The next best combination is a fully connected topology, constant weight adjustment, and 200 particles, as shown in Figure 13.
 Here, all but three tests converge near zero best fitness before the 1000 iterations. 
 The fully connected topology allows particles to learn the global optimum quickly, leading to faster convergence to both the center mass and the optimal fitness. 
 Subplot 3 shows less particle spread, and the velocity vectors drop to zero more quickly, signaling no further learning as all particles converge.

Given these results, I would choose the ring topology with constant weight adjustment and 200 particles to maintain variation and continued learning, despite slower convergence. 
The worst combination is star topology with non-linear weight adjustment and 20 particles, shown in Figure 6. The limited particle count and poor information sharing lead to suboptimal performance, 
making it the least effective choice.
